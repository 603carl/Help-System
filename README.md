The dashboard is designed to help analysts visualize and interact with intelligence data, and it includes features for file upload, data analysis, and PDF report generation.

Features
File Upload: Upload and analyze various file types (documents, images, audio, videos).
Interactive Visualizations: Geographical distribution maps, timelines, bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts, and trend analysis.
Data Filtering: Date range selector, event type multi-select, severity selector, location filter, and target sector filter.
No Results Found Handling: Provides feedback when no data matches the selected filters.
PDF Report Generation: Generates a customizable data analysis report based on user-selected data.
